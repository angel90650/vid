# Vid
Vid is a video streaming service. In this project I plan to develop a streaming service where I develop the streaming protocol used to transfer videos from a server to a client, manage memory in the buffer, and build in analytic tools for analyzing how different video segment sizes, buffer sizes affect the overall quality of the service. This project will have a user interface that lets users select a video and another interface where the video is played and can see the analytics of the video stream.

## This project involves:
  - Video Streaming
  - Encoding
  - Container format
  - Transport protocol
    - How to create and send media segments across the network and then rearrange them correctly.
  - Buffer management
    - How much of the video is stored on the client side at any given time
  - User Interface
  - The video player 
  - Analytics
    - Customizable metrics used to optimize performance. Will be helpful when doing performance evaluation
